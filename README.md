# My Neovim Config
I am a casual Linux (Pop OS) user that doesn't much do programing, but I wanted to ditch VSCode so I opted in to transition to Neovim with Packer as a plugin manager

>When is this going to be updated?

**When I remember it exists lol**

## How to install my settings:
#### Instructions for linux  
(Not going to make this for other operating system)  
 [Follow instruction for Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)  
 [Follow instructions for Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim#notices)
```
cd ~/ # to be sure that we are in the home/(user) directory
mkdir .config/ # if it doesn't already exists
cd ~/.config/ && git clone https://github.com/Battle420/neovim-config.git
mv neovim-config nvim #so that neovims knows what packs and config to use
```
# _That's all folks._
